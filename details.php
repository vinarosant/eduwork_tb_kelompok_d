                                    the refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece.
                                    The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It uses mirrors
                                    to focus the image that you eventually see.
                                    Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to give you a good clear
                                    image of what you are looking at. You want your telescope to have good collimation
                                    so you are not getting a false image of the celestial body.
                                    Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But it’s an
                                    important word because the aperture of the lens is the key to how powerful your
                                    telescope is. Magnification has nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture.
                                    Focuser is the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you will
                                    look through, in place. The focuser has to be stable and in good repair for you to
                                    have an image you can rely on.
                                    Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope sits on. The
                                    mount is the actual tripod and the wedge is the device that lets you attach the
                                    telescope to the mount.
